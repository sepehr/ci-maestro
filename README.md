#CodeIgniter Maestro
CodeIgniter Maestro is a ready-to-go customized codeigniter boilerplate app that let us kickstart the CI development with minimum level of effort.

I was in middle of coding this and I suddenly found a project called **Bonfire**, that's great but it does not support MongoDB and you know, deadlines were pushing me! Even though that this project will help you through your first stages of developing with CodeIgniter (and MongoDB specialy), but it has no future! I'm looking forward to contribute to the Bonfire project instead.  


Two more things:  

* This project is in early development stages.  
* Some components are replaced with Bonfire corresponding components, and not tested yet.
